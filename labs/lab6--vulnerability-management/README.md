## Lab Overview

This lab guide will walk you through setting up and using Nessus Essentials (formerly Nessus Home) for vulnerability scanning and management.

### Task 1: Installation and Initial Setup

1. Download Nessus Essentials

   - Visit https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus/nessus-essentials
   - Register for a free activation code
   - Download the appropriate package for your OS

   - Wait for initial plugin download (may take 15-30 minutes)

### Task 2: Basic Scanning

1. Create Your First Scan
   - Click "New Scan"
   - Select "Basic Network Scan"
   - Configure scan settings:
     - Name: "First Basic Scan"
     - Description: "Initial vulnerability assessment"
     - Targets: Enter your target IP (e.g., your local IP@)

### Task 3: Advanced Scanning Techniques

1. Credentialed Scans

   - Create a new scan using "Credentialed Patch Audit"
   - Configure credentials:

     Linux:
     - SSH username
     - Password or SSH key
     - Elevation method (sudo/su)
     ```

### Task 4: Results Analysis

1. Understanding Scan Results

   - Vulnerability severity levels:
     - Critical (CVSS 9.0-10.0)
     - High (CVSS 7.0-8.9)
     - Medium (CVSS 4.0-6.9)
     - Low (CVSS 0.1-3.9)
     - Info (CVSS 0.0)

2. Remediation Planning

   - Sort vulnerabilities by:
     - Risk (CVSS score)
     - Exploit availability
     - Ease of remediation
     - Business impact

3. Creating Reports
   - Generate executive summary
   - Detailed technical reports
   - Compliance reports
   - Delta reports for changes
